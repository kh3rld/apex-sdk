## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2025-11-24

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from ethers-rs to Alloy for EVM blockchain support
  - Updated all EVM provider types to use Alloy's modern API
  - Replaced `TypedTransaction` with `TransactionRequest` throughout
  - Updated transaction building to use Alloy's builder pattern
  - Changed hash types from `H256` to `B256` for consistency
  - Simplified provider architecture with unified HTTP support
- Updated transaction execution methods to use Alloy's native APIs
  - `estimate_gas` now uses `TransactionRequest::clone()`
  - `get_block_by_number` simplified to single-parameter API
  - Gas price and fee estimation updated for EIP-1559 support
- Enhanced `ProviderType` with cleaner public API
  - Made `get_chain_id()` public for external access
  - Added `AlloyHttpProvider` type alias to reduce type complexity
- Updated CLI to use non-deprecated Alloy methods
  - Replaced `on_http` with `connect_http` across all commands
  - Fixed type conversions for gas calculations
- Updated dependencies to latest versions:
  - `thiserror` 1.0 → 2.0.17 in apex-sdk-types
  - `rand` 0.8 → 0.9.2 in apex-sdk-core
  - Migrated to new rand 0.9 API (`thread_rng()` → `rng()`, `gen()` → `random()`)
  - All crates now use workspace-defined versions for consistency

### Fixed
- Resolved all clippy warnings related to type complexity
- Fixed provider method access patterns in transaction executor
- Corrected arithmetic operations to use proper U256 conversions
- Fixed CLI deploy command to work with new provider API
- Removed unused dependencies:
  - `sp-keyring` from apex-sdk-cli
  - `anyhow` and `thiserror` from apex-sdk-core
  - `anyhow` from apex-sdk-substrate
  - `hex` from apex-sdk-types
- Added cargo-udeps ignore annotations for dependencies used in generated code:
  - `sp-runtime` in apex-sdk-substrate (used in generated metadata files)
- Fixed CI dependency check to only validate root dependencies
  - Added `--root-deps-only` flag to cargo-outdated check
  - Transitive dependencies are managed by upstream crates (Alloy, Substrate)

### Known Issues
- `trie-db v0.30.0` has future incompatibility warnings related to never type fallback
  - This is a transitive dependency from Substrate packages (sp-trie, sp-state-machine)
  - Will be resolved when Parity updates the trie-db crate upstream
  - Does not affect current functionality

## [0.1.3] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- Enhanced CLI commands for account and configuration management
- Interactive configuration initialization with `apex config init`

- Project templates (default, defi, nft)
- Account generation and management commands
- Configuration show/set/get/validate/reset commands
- CLI README documentation

### Changed
- Improved CLI output messages for consistency and clarity
- Refactored keystore implementation for better readability
- Updated command structure with better organization
- Enhanced package metadata for crates.io

### Fixed
